# Real Time Yahtzee
### Author: Keyanna Duker

## Overview:
### Description: 
I wanted to try dipping into video object detection and algorithm design, so this project will use OpenCV to identify rolled dice and use them in Yahtzee. I want the game to be between a minimum of one player and the computer, where the computer needs to choose whether or not to reroll to get a higher score and how to utilze chance and other boxes in a reasonable amount of time.

## Development Environment
* Microsoft Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.9.0
* OpenCV
* Logitech C615 HD Webcam (However any webcam should be sufficient)

## Useful Websites
Useful websites incoming

## Future Work
I would eventually like to implement a GUI so the game is no longer played in the terminal.
