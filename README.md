# Real Time Yahtzee
### Author: Keyanna Duker
## Overview:
### Description: 
I wanted to try dipping into video object detection and algorithm design, so this project will use OpenCV to identify rolled dice and use them in Yahtzee. I want the game to be between a minimum of one player and the computer, where the computer needs to choose whether or not to reroll to get a higher score and how to utilze chance and other boxes in a reasonable amount of time.

## Development Environment
* Microsoft Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.9.0
* OpenCV
* Logitech C615 HD Webcam (However any webcam should be sufficient)

## Useful Websites

## Future Work
* Need to finish the computer player algorithm (Specifically where it tells the user what to reroll and selects the box to score if both rerolls are used). 
* Eventually I would like to refine the algorithm so it plays better.
* Give players the option to view their available score boxes at the beginning of their turn.
* I would eventually like to implement a GUI so the game is no longer played in the terminal.
